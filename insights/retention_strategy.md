# Customer Retention Strategy Based on Churn Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this strategy is to reduce customer churn by identifying high-risk customer segments and recommending data-driven retention actions based on insights derived from customer churn analysis.

## High-Risk Customer Segments
Based on the analysis performed on the customer churn data, the following segments are identified as having a higher likelihood of churn:

- Customers on month-to-month contracts
- Customers with tenure between 0–12 months
- Customers with higher monthly charges
- Customers using electronic check as their payment method

## Key Churn Drivers
The primary factors contributing to higher churn rates include:

- Lack of long-term commitment in month-to-month contracts
- Insufficient onboarding and engagement during the early customer lifecycle
- Price sensitivity among customers with higher monthly charges
- Lower convenience and trust associated with non-automatic payment methods

## Recommended Retention Actions
To address the identified churn drivers, the following retention strategies are recommended:

1. Contract-Based Incentives  
   - Offer discounts, bundled services, or loyalty benefits to encourage month-to-month customers to shift to long-term contracts.

2. Improved Customer Onboarding  
   - Strengthen onboarding and engagement programs during the first 90 days to improve early customer experience and reduce initial churn.

3. Pricing Optimization  
   - Introduce personalized pricing plans or loyalty discounts for customers with higher monthly charges to reduce price-related churn.

4. Payment Method Optimization  
   - Encourage customers to switch to automatic payment methods by providing small incentives such as cashback or service credits.

## Expected Business Impact
Implementing the above retention strategies is expected to:

- Reduce overall customer churn rate
- Increase customer lifetime value (CLV)
- Improve revenue predictability through long-term contracts
- Enhance customer satisfaction and brand loyalty

## Conclusion
This retention strategy provides a structured, data-driven approach to identifying churn risks and implementing targeted actions that can help improve customer retention and long-term business performance.
